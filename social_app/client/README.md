There are various APIs that display pollution data globally, including air quality, water quality, and soil quality. Some popular APIs for air pollution data include OpenAQ, AirVisual, and Airly. For water pollution data, Water Quality Index API and Waterkeeper Alliance API are some examples. For soil quality data, Agro API provides data on soil parameters such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient levels.
